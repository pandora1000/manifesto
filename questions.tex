\textbf{Do you believe in repatriation of British citizens
    of foreign heritage?}\\
No. And we will never have that word attributed to our cause.
Our stance on repatriation is that it is a cruel exodus
that divides but does not solve.

\textbf{What is your stance on LGBTQ and Transgender?}

If this is to be seen as a threat to morals and Christian values, then the party has nothing to comment on the matter. The state is bias from all Holy Books. In private, people will be allowed to love as they please and identify in which they choose. In public we ask, that children remain free to pursuit a nurturing and free childhood, in which they are not hammered down with sexuality and identification.

    \textbf{What must be done to tackle Britain's drug epidemic?}

    We view this as negative freedom and see it as the role of the state to intervene when an individual has lost all control of themselves and their treatment of others around.
    We have an absolute hardline stance on drugs which break up families, disrupt the psyche and which cause social decay.
